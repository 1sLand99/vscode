connor4312: Currently the chatEditingSession and its timeline store the state of changes based on snapshots of the working set. However, this is not good because it does not accurately represent file deletions, renames, and modifications. I think there are also some bugs with it. Create a plan to architect a new version of the edit session timline. Roughly:

1. It should have a 'checkpoint' feature that are used to implement navigation to and from undo stops. It should also be aware of requests (edits can be tagged with a requestId)
2. The first time a file is edited within for a request, we should 'snapshot' its initial content. But then each subsequent modification should be stored _as an edit_ to that file.
3. We should be able to represent file creations, deletions, and renames as operations. In addition to text and notebook edits.
4. Undo/redo is implemented by navigation to the previous or subsequent checkpoint. To implement this, we see what file-level operations (rename/delete/create) happened in the meantime, and undo those. Then for files that had edits, we actually take the last snapshot and then replay edits to that content to get to the snapshotted state.

Note that the new edit timeline should not actually use the existing _createSnapshot etc. functionality at all.

Research and create a plan on how to implement this. Let me know if you have any open questions or ambiguities.

GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze the current chat editing session architecture and create a plan for a new timeline system. Let me first research the existing implementation to understand the current challenges.

Starting (4/7) *Design checkpoint-based timeline architecture*

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current architecture. Let me design the new checkpoint-based timeline system.

## Analysis of Current System Limitations

Based on my research, the current system has several issues:

1. **Snapshot-based approach**: The current timeline stores complete snapshots of file contents at each undo stop, which doesn't accurately represent operations like file deletions, renames, or creation.

2. **Inefficient storage**: Full snapshots consume significant memory and disk space, especially for large files with minor changes.

3. **Limited operation tracking**: The system only tracks text content changes, not file system operations like create/delete/rename.

4. **Complex restore logic**: `_restoreSnapshot` has to completely recreate the file state, which can be error-prone with file operations.

5. **Timeline complexity**: The current `ChatEditingTimeline` uses a complex linear history with snapshot indices that's difficult to reason about.

Let me now design a new checkpoint-based timeline architecture:

Starting (5/7) *Design file operation representation*

## New Checkpoint-Based Timeline Architecture

Here's my comprehensive plan for redesigning the edit session timeline:

### 1. Core Data Structures

```typescript
// Base operation interface
interface IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType;
	readonly uri: URI;
	readonly requestId: string;
	readonly timestamp: number;
	readonly operationId: string; // unique identifier
}

enum FileOperationType {
	Create = 'create',
	Delete = 'delete',
	Rename = 'rename',
	TextEdit = 'textEdit',
	NotebookEdit = 'notebookEdit'
}

// Specific operation types
interface IFileCreateOperation extends IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType.Create;
	readonly initialContent: string;
	readonly languageId: string;
}

interface IFileDeleteOperation extends IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType.Delete;
	readonly finalContent: string; // content before deletion
	readonly languageId: string;
}

interface IFileRenameOperation extends IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType.Rename;
	readonly oldUri: URI;
	readonly newUri: URI;
}

interface ITextEditOperation extends IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType.TextEdit;
	readonly edits: TextEdit[];
	readonly contentBefore: string; // for diff computation
	readonly contentAfter: string;
}

interface INotebookEditOperation extends IFileOperation {
	readonly type: FileOperationType.NotebookEdit;
	readonly cellEdits: ICellEditOperation[];
	readonly notebookContentBefore: string;
	readonly notebookContentAfter: string;
}

// Checkpoint represents a stable state that can be navigated to
interface ICheckpoint {
	readonly checkpointId: string;
	readonly requestId: string | undefined; // undefined for initial state
	readonly undoStopId: string | undefined;
	readonly timestamp: number;
	readonly label: string; // for UI display
	readonly operations: readonly IFileOperation[]; // operations that led to this checkpoint
}

// File baseline - the first snapshot taken when a file is first edited in a request
interface IFileBaseline {
	readonly uri: URI;
	readonly requestId: string;
	readonly content: string;
	readonly languageId: string;
	readonly timestamp: number;
}
```

Starting (6/7) *Design undo/redo implementation*

### 2. New Timeline Architecture

```typescript
interface IChatEditingCheckpointTimeline {
	// Navigation
	readonly currentCheckpoint: IObservable<ICheckpoint | undefined>;
	readonly canUndo: IObservable<boolean>;
	readonly canRedo: IObservable<boolean>;

	// Checkpoint management
	createCheckpoint(requestId: string | undefined, undoStopId: string | undefined, label: string): void;
	navigateToCheckpoint(checkpointId: string): Promise<void>;
	undoToLastCheckpoint(): Promise<void>;
	redoToNextCheckpoint(): Promise<void>;

	// Operation tracking
	recordFileOperation(operation: IFileOperation): void;
	getOperationsSince(checkpointId: string): readonly IFileOperation[];
	getOperationsBetween(fromCheckpointId: string, toCheckpointId: string): readonly IFileOperation[];

	// File baselines
	recordFileBaseline(baseline: IFileBaseline): void;
	getFileBaseline(uri: URI, requestId: string): IFileBaseline | undefined;

	// State reconstruction
	reconstructFileState(uri: URI, targetCheckpointId: string): Promise<IReconstructedFileState>;

	// Persistence
	getStateForPersistence(): IChatEditingTimelineState;
	restoreFromState(state: IChatEditingTimelineState): void;
}

interface IReconstructedFileState {
	readonly exists: boolean;
	readonly content: string | undefined;
	readonly languageId: string | undefined;
	readonly uri: URI; // final URI after any renames
}

interface IChatEditingTimelineState {
	readonly checkpoints: readonly ICheckpoint[];
	readonly currentCheckpointId: string | undefined;
	readonly fileBaselines: ReadonlyMap<string, IFileBaseline>; // key: `${uri}::${requestId}`
	readonly operations: readonly IFileOperation[];
}
```

### 3. Timeline Implementation Strategy

The new timeline will work as follows:

1. **Operation Recording**: Instead of storing full snapshots, record discrete operations as they happen
2. **Baseline Capture**: When a file is first edited in a request, capture its initial state as a baseline
3. **Checkpoint Creation**: Create checkpoints at undo stops that reference the operations leading to that state
4. **State Reconstruction**: To restore to a checkpoint, start from the appropriate baseline and replay operations

### 4. Undo/Redo Implementation

```typescript
class ChatEditingCheckpointTimeline implements IChatEditingCheckpointTimeline {

	async navigateToCheckpoint(targetCheckpointId: string): Promise<void> {
		const targetCheckpoint = this.findCheckpoint(targetCheckpointId);
		if (!targetCheckpoint) {
			throw new Error(`Checkpoint ${targetCheckpointId} not found`);
		}

		// 1. Get all affected files by analyzing operations between current and target
		const affectedFiles = this.getAffectedFilesBetweenCheckpoints(
			this.currentCheckpointId,
			targetCheckpointId
		);

		// 2. For each affected file, reconstruct its state at the target checkpoint
		const reconstructions = new Map<URI, IReconstructedFileState>();
		for (const uri of affectedFiles) {
			const reconstructed = await this.reconstructFileState(uri, targetCheckpointId);
			reconstructions.set(uri, reconstructed);
		}

		// 3. Apply all file system operations (creates, deletes, renames) first
		await this.applyFileSystemChanges(reconstructions);

		// 4. Apply content changes to existing files
		await this.applyContentChanges(reconstructions);

		// 5. Update current checkpoint
		this.setCurrentCheckpoint(targetCheckpointId);
	}

	async reconstructFileState(uri: URI, targetCheckpointId: string): Promise<IReconstructedFileState> {
		const targetCheckpoint = this.findCheckpoint(targetCheckpointId);

		// Find the appropriate baseline (most recent one before target checkpoint)
		const baseline = this.findBaselineForFile(uri, targetCheckpoint.requestId);
		if (!baseline) {
			return { exists: false, content: undefined, languageId: undefined, uri };
		}

		// Get all operations for this file from baseline to target checkpoint
		const operations = this.getFileOperationsInRange(uri, baseline.requestId, targetCheckpointId);

		// Replay operations to reconstruct state
		return this.replayOperations(baseline, operations, targetCheckpointId);
	}

	private async replayOperations(
		baseline: IFileBaseline,
		operations: readonly IFileOperation[],
		targetCheckpointId: string
	): Promise<IReconstructedFileState> {
		let currentState: IReconstructedFileState = {
			exists: true,
			content: baseline.content,
			languageId: baseline.languageId,
			uri: baseline.uri
		};

		for (const operation of operations) {
			// Stop if we've reached operations beyond our target checkpoint
			if (!this.isOperationBeforeCheckpoint(operation, targetCheckpointId)) {
				break;
			}

			currentState = await this.applyOperationToState(currentState, operation);
		}

		return currentState;
	}

	private async applyOperationToState(
		state: IReconstructedFileState,
		operation: IFileOperation
	): Promise<IReconstructedFileState> {
		switch (operation.type) {
			case FileOperationType.Create:
				const createOp = operation as IFileCreateOperation;
				return {
					exists: true,
					content: createOp.initialContent,
					languageId: createOp.languageId,
					uri: operation.uri
				};

			case FileOperationType.Delete:
				return {
					exists: false,
					content: undefined,
					languageId: undefined,
					uri: operation.uri
				};

			case FileOperationType.Rename:
				const renameOp = operation as IFileRenameOperation;
				return {
					...state,
					uri: renameOp.newUri
				};

			case FileOperationType.TextEdit:
				const textOp = operation as ITextEditOperation;
				if (!state.exists) {
					throw new Error('Cannot apply text edits to non-existent file');
				}
				// Apply text edits to reconstruct content
				const newContent = await this.applyTextEditsToContent(state.content!, textOp.edits);
				return {
					...state,
					content: newContent
				};

			case FileOperationType.NotebookEdit:
				const notebookOp = operation as INotebookEditOperation;
				if (!state.exists) {
					throw new Error('Cannot apply notebook edits to non-existent file');
				}
				// Apply notebook edits
				const newNotebookContent = await this.applyNotebookEditsToContent(
					state.content!,
					notebookOp.cellEdits
				);
				return {
					...state,
					content: newNotebookContent
				};
		}
	}
}
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Session

```typescript
// Modified ChatEditingSession to use the new timeline
class ChatEditingSession extends Disposable implements IChatEditingSession {
	private readonly _checkpointTimeline: IChatEditingCheckpointTimeline;

	constructor(/* existing params */) {
		super();
		this._checkpointTimeline = this._instantiationService.createInstance(ChatEditingCheckpointTimeline);
	}

	// Replace existing snapshot methods
	public createCheckpoint(requestId: string, undoStop: string | undefined): void {
		const label = undoStop ? `Request ${requestId} - Stop ${undoStop}` : `Request ${requestId}`;
		this._checkpointTimeline.createCheckpoint(requestId, undoStop, label);
	}

	public async restoreCheckpoint(requestId: string, stopId: string | undefined): Promise<void> {
		const checkpointId = this.getCheckpointId(requestId, stopId);
		if (checkpointId) {
			await this._checkpointTimeline.navigateToCheckpoint(checkpointId);
		}
	}

	async undoInteraction(): Promise<void> {
		await this._checkpointTimeline.undoToLastCheckpoint();
	}

	async redoInteraction(): Promise<void> {
		await this._checkpointTimeline.redoToNextCheckpoint();
	}

	// Modified file operation recording
	private async _recordFileOperation(operation: IFileOperation): Promise<void> {
		this._checkpointTimeline.recordFileOperation(operation);
	}

	private async _ensureFileBaseline(uri: URI, requestId: string): Promise<void> {
		if (!this._checkpointTimeline.getFileBaseline(uri, requestId)) {
			// Capture initial content as baseline
			const content = await this._getFileContent(uri);
			const languageId = this._getLanguageId(uri);

			this._checkpointTimeline.recordFileBaseline({
				uri,
				requestId,
				content,
				languageId,
				timestamp: Date.now()
			});
		}
	}
}
```

## Implementation Plan

Completed (7/7) *Create implementation plan*

## Complete Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures and Interfaces
1. **Create new interface files**:
   - `chatEditingOperations.ts` - Define `IFileOperation` and its subtypes
   - `chatEditingCheckpointTimeline.ts` - Define `IChatEditingCheckpointTimeline` interface
   - `chatEditingTimelineState.ts` - Define persistence interfaces

2. **Create new classes**:
   - `ChatEditingCheckpointTimeline` - Core timeline implementation
   - `FileOperationRecorder` - Helper for recording operations
   - `FileStateReconstructor` - Helper for replaying operations

### Phase 2: Timeline Implementation
1. **Implement `ChatEditingCheckpointTimeline`**:
   - Checkpoint creation and navigation
   - Operation recording and retrieval
   - File baseline management
   - State reconstruction logic
   - Persistence support

2. **Create operation replay system**:
   - Text edit application logic
   - Notebook edit application logic
   - File system operation handling
   - URI tracking for renames

### Phase 3: Integration
1. **Modify `ChatEditingSession`**:
   - Replace `_timeline` with `_checkpointTimeline`
   - Update `createSnapshot` → `createCheckpoint`
   - Update `restoreSnapshot` → `navigateToCheckpoint`
   - Modify streaming edit methods to record operations
   - Update undo/redo methods

2. **Update file entry classes**:
   - Modify `AbstractChatEditingModifiedFileEntry` to record operations
   - Remove snapshot creation logic
   - Update edit acceptance to record operations

### Phase 4: Migration and Testing
1. **Create migration logic**:
   - Convert existing timeline state to checkpoint format
   - Preserve existing undo/redo functionality during transition

2. **Add comprehensive tests**:
   - Operation recording and replay
   - File system operation handling
   - Complex undo/redo scenarios
   - State persistence and restoration

### Phase 5: Performance and Polish
1. **Optimize operation storage**:
   - Implement operation compaction for old requests
   - Add efficient querying for file operations
   - Memory usage optimization

2. **UI improvements**:
   - Enhanced checkpoint labeling
   - Better progress indication during navigation
   - Improved error handling and recovery

## Key Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Accurate File Operations**: Properly represents creates, deletes, and renames
2. **Efficient Storage**: Only stores deltas instead of full file snapshots
3. **Better Debugging**: Clear operation trail for troubleshooting
4. **Scalability**: More efficient with large files and many operations
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new operation types in the future
6. **Consistency**: Deterministic state reconstruction through operation replay

## Open Questions for Clarification

1. **Operation Granularity**: Should we record individual text edits or batch them per streaming request?

2. **Baseline Strategy**: Should we create baselines for every request or only when files are first modified in a session?

3. **Operation Compaction**: How aggressive should we be in compacting old operations for performance?

4. **Error Recovery**: How should we handle cases where operation replay fails (e.g., conflicting file states)?

5. **Migration Timeline**: Should we implement this as a feature flag initially or replace the existing system entirely?

6. **Testing Strategy**: Would you prefer to implement this incrementally with backwards compatibility, or as a complete replacement?

This architecture provides a robust foundation for accurate file operation tracking while maintaining the existing API surface for minimal disruption to consumers.

connor4312: 1. Record individual edits
2. Baselines for each file should be created the first time they're edited per-request, because the user might have modified the files in the interim.
3. Don't worry about compacting old operations yet.
4. Replay should never error, because you're replaying edits off an older baseline so you know they were applied already.
5. Replace the old system entirely.
6. Test is as a complete replacement.

If this sounds good, let's start implementing!
